        <p>Hello!˙</p>
        <p>I am <strong>GyuMin Eric Gabriel Choi</strong> (Korean: 최규민; Chinese: 崔圭玟; born June 27, 2003), a Korean international scholar, musician, YouTuber and an aspiring lawyer and policymaker. </p>
        <br>
        <p class="font_h3">Early life</p>
        <p>I was born in Seoul, South Korea, on June 27, 2003. I moved to Vancouver, Canada with my family when I was 3, and then moved to Shanghai, China in 2007.
            Then I moved with my family back to Seoul in 2011. When I was 9, my family moved to Beijing, China in 2012 and attended Dulwich College Beijing, a British international school in Beijing. 
            During my time there, I served as the Student Council Chairperson and founded the Current Affairs Society.
            I spent a portion of my summer in 2019 taking a course on Politics at Stanford University.
            I spent the summer of 2020 working as an intern at the Pangoal Institution, a China-based public policy thinktank.
            In 2021, I graduated from Dulwich College Beijing.˙
        </p>
        <p>Now, I am a freshman at the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California.</p>
        
        <br>
        <p class="font_h3">Influencer</p>
        <p>I am a video content creator on YouTube. I make music cover videos, and post vlogs about current affairs and my life.
        <!-- As of 2021, I have over 100 YouTube subscribers. -->
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="font_h3">Personal life.</p>
        <p>I speak fluent English, Korean and Chinese. My interests include singing, reading, writing.</p>

        <br><br><br>
        <p>I feel incredibly privileged to share what I am learning and connect with so many incredible people and here on CHOI.com. Thank you for reading!</p>
