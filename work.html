            <p>Despite the obstacles in China to hold religious meetings, devout Korean Catholics founded the Community on Sep. 1993 at St. Michael's Cathedral. To this day, the congregation becomes one in faith of God to join forces and confront various barriers.
                I assisted the Reverend in liturgies to make it more blessed and holy to all believers' life of faith, cultivated spirit and educated the catechism. For my long-lasting leading of the monthly acolyte preparation meetings for Sunday Mass, Retreats and Holy Hour service, I was awarded the Commendation Award of Service.

            <p>In August 2019, I launched a program in Dulwich College Beijing intending to promote a campus dialogue on current affairs.
                It started as a small open discussion group for my peers and slowly grew into a larger student organisation with over 30 active members and student leaders.
                As a team we prepared discussion material on topics and issues affecting China and East Asia, hosted forums for students and guest speakers and carried out projects within our aims.
                One of the key projects which I was heavily invovled in was presenting the "Last Month Tonight" shows and newsletters, concisely summarising important news events.

            <p>
                As the first sophomore to be elected as Chairperson, I directed the creation of the constitution to address needs of the student body.
                During my tenure I also initiated the United Students of Beijing initiative, a forum for student leaders to create intra-school programs & activities for Beijing international student community.
                In the year before, I was the Secretary, where I managed the renovation of the IB Common Room & school store.

            <p>Check out my YouTube channel:</p>
            <p>As a creator, I developed my creative idea and identity through producing and sharing content (cover songs, news/current affairs vlogs, photography, education).
                Other than developing, filming and editing these videos in the production stage, I make marketing plans to promote my videos after their release and manage the overall design and layout of the channel.</p>
